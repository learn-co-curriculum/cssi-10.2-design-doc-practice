##DESIGN DOC PRACTICE 

###Objective SWBAT:
* In teams make the bulk of a design doc for a previous CSSI App

### Motivation / Why Should You Care?
This is a risk-free way to practice the skills of breaking down an app


Now that youâ€™ve seen how the design doc process works, you are going to repeat the process, but this time you are going to pick a different project from a previous class. 
Remember, just like we practiced, you are mocking up the MVP, what is the most basic possible function? 

Even though Movie Spotter did a lot, we first just wanted to design something that would take in user input, match it to a pre-built dictionary, and show the matches on a results.html. After that was done, then we worried about adding an API and making it pretty.



### DESIGN DOC PRACTICE
1. Choose an existing application from [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QV1rLF1FKh8kz-FLy1VbwXozvNVkXRtsCc3zVXHp3YI).
2. Break it down into the pieces (Views and Controller). 
3. Produce a design doc with a Gliffy flowchart representing the architecture of their app. [Gliffy offers a free 14-day trial]
4. Be prepared to explain the design doc your wrote with another group at the end of your time
